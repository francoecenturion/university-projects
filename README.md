# ðŸŽ“ University projects
Welcome to my university software development projects portfolio. Here, you will find a collection of projects that I have undertaken in collaboration with my classmates during my academic journey.

## [TP Sistemas Operativos](https://github.com/francoecenturion/university-projects/tree/main/sistemas-operativos-tp)

The project comprises an operating-system-like application made up of five interconnected modules. These modules communicate via sockets, simulating the behavior of an actual operating system by performing tasks such as executing processes, creating and deleting files, and monitoring memory usage.


## [TP DiseÃ±o de Sistemas](https://github.com/francoecenturion/university-projects/tree/main/disenio-de-sistemas-tp)

This project consists of a full-stack web application designed to serve as a support system for communities of people with reduced mobility. The application allows real-time monitoring of the status of various services offered in public establishments, such as escalators and elevators in train stations.

The front end of the application is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an intuitive and accessible user interface. On the other hand, the back end is developed in Java. The database used is PostgreSQL, managed via Hibernate for object-relational mapping. Additionally, Handlebars is used as the template engine to dynamically render content on the server.

The system also integrates with various APIs to enhance its functionality and offer a more comprehensive user experience. One of the key integrations is with the Georef API, which provides detailed information about the provinces, departments, and municipalities of Argentina. This allows the application to offer precise and up-to-date data on the location of public services.
